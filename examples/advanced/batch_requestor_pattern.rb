# HornetQ Batch Requestor Pattern:
#      Submit a batch of requests and wait for replies
#
# This is an advanced use case where the client submits requests in a controlled
# fashion. The alternative would be just to submit all requests at the same time,
# however then it becomes extremely difficult to pull back submitted requests
# if say 80% of the first say 100 requests fail.
#
# This sample sends a total of 100 requests in batches of 10.
# One thread sends requests and the other processes replies.
# Once 80% of the replies are back, it will send the next batch
#
# Maybe one day this pattern can make it out of examples and into the product :)

class BatchRequestorPattern
  
  attr_accessor :batch_size, :window_size, :completion_ratio
  attr_reader :reply_address, :reply_count, :send_count
  
  # 
  # Returns a new BatchRequestorPattern
  # 
  # Parameters:
  # * connection: The HornetQ connection. Used for creating sessions for the
  #               pattern to run
  # * server_address: The address to send requests to
  # * An optional block can be passed in that will be called with every reply
  #   It can be used to perform specialized handling such as:
  # ** Aborting a batch process
  # ** Moving the response to another queue for re-queuing later
  # 
  # Implementation:
  # 
  # Creates a temporary reply to queue for receiving responses from the server
  #   Consists of the server_address following by a '.' and a UUID
  #   
  # Uses Connection#on_message to process replies in a separate thread
  # 
  # If the connection is started, it will start consuming replies immediately,
  # otherwise it will only start processing replies once the connection has
  # been started.
  # 
  # Sending of messages should be done by only one thread at a time since
  # this pattern shares the same session and producer for sending messages
  #
  # Parameters
  # * :connection Connection to create session and response queue with
  # * :server_address Address to send requests to
  # * :completion_ratio Percentage of responses to wait for before sending
  #                     further requests
  #                     Must be a number between 0 and 1 inclusive
  #                     Default: 0.8
