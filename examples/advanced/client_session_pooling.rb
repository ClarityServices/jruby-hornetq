# HornetQ Requestor using session_pooling:
#      Multithreaded clients all doing requests. 
#      
#      Shows how the same session can be used safely on different threads
#      rather than each thread having to create its own session
#      
#      Typical scenario is in a Rails app when we need to do a call to a
#      remote server and block until a response is received
#

# Allow examples to be run in-place without requiring a gem install
