# The Batch Client Pattern submits requests to a server following the Server Pattern
#
# A good example of when to use the Batch Client Pattern is when processing large
# batch files. Rather than just flood the queue with every record from a file
# the Batch Client Pattern can be used to only send out a batch of requests at
# a time and when sufficient responses have been received, send another batch.
# 
# The following additional features can be implemented in this pattern
# * Stop the batch if say 80% of records fail in the first batch, etc.
# * Support pause and resume of batch processing
# * Support restart and recoverability
# 
# See the Resque example for implementations of some of the above capabilities
